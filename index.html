				<p>Well . . . where to start? I like dark roast coffee, heavy metal, craft beer, and long walks in the mountains. My hobbies include reading, hand lettering, puzzles, and riding my mountain bike.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I grew up in Northeast Ohio and went to college at Ohio University. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism and minored in English creative writing. While in college, I worked in magazine and book publishing. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Upon graduation, I decided to pursue a career in marketing. For the past four years, I have had some great experiences in digital and event marketingâ€”but it wasn't my calling. I am hoping to combine what I know of marketing and design, and the skills learned in this bootcamp, to build creative and engaging websites.</p>
