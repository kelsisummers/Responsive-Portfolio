			<p>
				Well . . . where to start? I like dark roast coffee, heavy metal, craft beer, and long walks in the mountains. My hobbies include reading, hand lettering, puzzles, and riding my mountain bike.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I grew up in Northeast Ohio and went to college at Ohio University. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism and minored in English creative writing. While in college, I worked in magazine and book publishing. 

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Upon graduation, I decided to pursue a career in marketing. For the past four years, I have had some great experiences in digital and event marketingâ€”but it wasn't my calling. I am hoping to combine what I know of marketing and design, and the skills learned in this bootcamp, to build creative and engaging websites.
